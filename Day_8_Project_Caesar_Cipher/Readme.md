# Caesar Cipher üîê

## Project Overview
This is a **Caesar Cipher** implementation in Python that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. The user can specify a shift amount, and the program will perform the transformation accordingly.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter a message.
2. A shift number is provided to determine how many positions each letter will move.
3. The user selects whether to **encode (encrypt)** or **decode (decrypt)** the message.
4. The program applies the shift and displays the transformed text.
5. The user can choose to restart or exit the program.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Loops** (to iterate through characters in the message)
- **Lists & Strings** (to manipulate text and alphabets)
- **Functions** (to modularize encryption and decryption logic)
- **Modulo Operator** (to handle letter shifts within the alphabet range)
- **User Input Handling** (to make the program interactive)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_8_Project_Caesar_Cipher
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to **encrypt** or **decrypt** your messages!
