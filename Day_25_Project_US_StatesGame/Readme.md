# 🗺️ Day 25 - U.S. States Game: Learn Geography with Python

This project is an interactive **U.S. States Guessing Game** built using **Turtle Graphics** and **Pandas**.  
It displays a blank U.S. map and lets users type in state names to label them on the map in real time.

## 🚀 Project Name: U.S. States Game – Interactive Map Quiz

Test your knowledge of U.S. geography with this educational game.  
With every correct guess, the state's name appears on the map in its proper location.

---

## 🧠 Features Implemented

✅ Interactive map using `Turtle` and `.gif` support  
✅ User input validation and case formatting  
✅ State name writing with coordinates from CSV  
✅ "Exit" option to end the game and generate missing states  
✅ Creates `learn_missing_states.csv` for future learning

├── blank_states_img.gif         # U.S. map used by Turtle

└── main.py                      # Core game logic
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The game shows a blank U.S. map (GIF image).
2. The player is prompted to guess state names one by one.
3. Correct guesses display the state name on the map.
4. Typing `Exit` ends the game and creates a CSV file of states left to guess.

## 📌 Concepts Covered

✅ GUI with Turtle Graphics  
✅ Reading CSV data using Pandas  
✅ Writing text on the screen using Turtle  
✅ Data filtering and coordinate mapping  
✅ Creating a CSV file with missing values

## 💡 Fun Fact

The **Turtle** graphics module only supports **.gif** images for backgrounds — a quirky but fun limitation that keeps things simple and retro.  
Perfect for visual learning and beginner-friendly game development!
