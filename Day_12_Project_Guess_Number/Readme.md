# Number Guessing Game 🎯

## Project Overview
This is a **Number Guessing Game** where the computer picks a random number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback if the guess is **too high, too low, or correct**.

## How It Works
1. The player selects a **difficulty level**:
   - **Easy:** 10 attempts
   - **Hard:** 5 attempts
   - If an incorrect input is given, the game defaults to **Easy mode**.
2. The game generates a **random number** between **1 and 100**.
3. The player makes a guess:
   - If correct, the player **wins**!
   - If incorrect, the game gives hints (**Too High** or **Too Low**) and reduces the attempts.
4. The player keeps guessing until they **win** or **run out of attempts**.
5. After the game ends, the player can choose to **play again or exit**.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Functions & Return Values** (for game structure)
- **Conditional Statements** (to check user input and determine results)
- **Random Module** (to generate a random number)
- **Loops** (for repeated guesses and retrying the game)
- **User Input Handling** (to accept and validate user choices)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_12_Project_Guess_Number
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing.py
   ```
4. Choose a difficulty level and start guessing! 🎲
