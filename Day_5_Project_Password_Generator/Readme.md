# Password Generator 🔐

## Project Overview
This **Password Generator** allows users to create strong and secure passwords with a customizable mix of **alphabets, numbers, and special characters**. Users can specify the desired length and composition, and the program generates a random password accordingly.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the number of **alphabets, numbers, and special characters** they want in their password.
2. The program randomly selects the specified amount of characters from each category.
3. All characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.
4. The final password is displayed.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Random module** (to generate random characters)
- **String module** (to access letters, digits, and special characters)
- **Functions** (to structure the code into reusable parts)
- **Lists and String Manipulation** (to manage character selection and shuffling)
- **User Input Handling** (to customize password generation)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_5_Project_Password_Generator
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```
4. Enter the desired number of **alphabets, numbers, and special characters**.
5. Get your **randomly generated secure password!** 🔑
