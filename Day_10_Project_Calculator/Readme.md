# Calculator ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Overview
This project is a **simple calculator** built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** interactively.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by displaying a calculator ASCII art.
2. The user is prompted to input the first number.
3. A list of available operations (+, -, *, /) is shown.
4. The user selects an operation and enters the second number.
5. The program calculates the result and displays it.
6. The user can choose to continue with the current result or start a new calculation.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Functions** (to perform calculations)
- **Dictionaries** (to store operations as function references)
- **Recursion** (to restart the calculator)
- **Loops** (to allow continuous calculations)
- **String formatting** (for clear output)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_10_Project_Calculator
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations!

## ASCII Art Resource
