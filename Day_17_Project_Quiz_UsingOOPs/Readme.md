# Day 17 - Python Quiz Master

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Python Quiz Master** is an interactive True/False quiz game built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The program dynamically pulls questions from a dataset, tracks the user’s score, and provides instant feedback after each question.

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ The program loads a **set of True/False questions** from a data file.  
2️⃣ Each question is presented to the player, and they must **answer True or False**.  
3️⃣ The program **checks the answer**, updates the score, and provides feedback.  
4️⃣ The quiz continues until all questions have been answered.  
5️⃣ At the end, the user’s **final score** is displayed. 🎯  

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- **`main.py`** → The entry point that initializes the quiz and handles game flow.
- **`question_model.py`** → Defines the `Question` class for handling individual questions.
- **`quiz_brain.py`** → Manages the quiz logic, scoring, and question handling.
- **`data.py`** → Stores the set of **True/False questions** for the quiz.

## 📌 Concepts Covered

✅ **Classes & Objects** (OOP implementation)  
✅ **Encapsulation & Abstraction** (Separating logic into different files)  
✅ **Loops & Conditional Statements** (Handling quiz flow and answer validation)  
✅ **Dynamic Data Handling** (Loading questions from a dataset)  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** None (built entirely using core Python features)
