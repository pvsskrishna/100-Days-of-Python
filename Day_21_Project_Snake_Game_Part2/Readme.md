# 🐍 Day 21 - Snake Game Part 2: Full-Fledged Classic Snake Game

Welcome to **Day 21** of my [#100DaysOfPython](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/100daysofpython/) journey!  
Today’s project is the **Part 2 of the Classic Snake Game**, where we bring everything together to complete a playable arcade-style snake game using **Python Turtle Graphics**. 🎮✨

---

## 🚀 Project Name: Snake Game Part 2 – Ultimate Classic Arcade 🕹️

This version builds upon the snake movement (from Part 1 – Day 20) and introduces **boundaries**, **scoreboard**, **food mechanics**, and **game-over logic**, making it feel like the complete classic arcade experience.

---

## 🧠 Features Implemented

✅ Snake movement using arrow keys  
✅ Food generation and collision detection  
✅ Snake growth after eating food  
✅ Dynamic scoreboard that updates  
✅ Wall boundaries to confine movement  
✅ Game over screen on collision  
✅ Tail collision logic

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Press **Arrow Keys** to control the snake:  
  ↕️ Up / Down / Left / Right  
- Eat the blue food to grow and score points.  
- Avoid running into the walls or your own tail.  
- Score increases by 1 for every bite!  
- Game ends when you hit a wall or bite yourself.

## 🗂️ Files and Their Roles

| File Name       | Role Description |
|----------------|------------------|
| `main.py`      | Main game loop and event bindings |
| `snake.py`     | Handles snake creation, movement, growth |
| `food.py`      | Handles food generation and refreshing |
| `scoreboard.py`| Tracks and displays score |
| `boundary.py`  | Draws the red playing boundary |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Inheritance)
- Keyboard event handling with `onkey`
- Real-time screen updates using `tracer` and `update`
- Collision detection with distance and coordinates
- Dynamic UI elements using Turtle

## 📸 Sneak Peek

> 🟦 Blue food, 🟥 Red boundary, 🐍 White snake, and a clean **“Game Over”** screen — you’re going to love it!

## 💡 Fun Fact

Turtle Graphics was created to help **children learn programming concepts visually**. The name “turtle” comes from an actual robot that was shaped like a turtle and moved around to draw on paper!
