# Day 16 - Coffee Machine using OOP

## 🔥 Project Overview

This project is a **Coffee Machine Simulator** implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. It builds upon the procedural approach used in Day 15 by incorporating classes and objects to make the code more structured and reusable.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The coffee machine offers three drinks: **Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino**.
- The program utilizes three core classes:
  - `CoffeeMaker` - Handles resources and coffee preparation.
  - `Menu` - Stores menu items and finds drinks.
  - `MoneyMachine` - Manages payment processing.
- The user selects a drink, inserts coins, and the machine processes the order.
- Special commands:
  - **`off`** - Turns off the machine.
  - **`report`** - Displays the available resources and money collected.

## 📌 Concepts Covered

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation and Data Management
- Handling User Input
- Managing Resources and Transactions
- Conditional Logic and Error Handling

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Modules Used:** None (Built-in features of Python)

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## 🆚 Procedural vs. OOP Approach

### **Day 15 - Procedural Approach**
- Uses functions for different tasks.
- Code is **less modular** and harder to scale.
- Global variables manage resources and transactions.

### **Day 16 - OOP Approach**
- Uses **classes** to encapsulate data and functionality.
- Code is **more structured** and **reusable**.
- Each component (Menu, CoffeeMaker, MoneyMachine) is **independent**, making modifications easier.

## 🎉 Fun Facts About This Coffee Machine

- The concept of a **coffee vending machine** dates back to **1947**!
- The world's largest coffee cup holds over **22,739 liters** of coffee!
- **Espresso** means "pressed out" in Italian, referring to the brewing process.
- The coffee industry is valued at **over $100 billion worldwide**!
