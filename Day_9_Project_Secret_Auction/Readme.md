# Blind Auction Program üèÜ

## Project Overview
This is a **Blind Auction** program in Python that allows multiple bidders to place their bids anonymously. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder is declared the winner.

## How It Works
1. A user enters their **name** and **bid amount**.
2. The program asks if there are any other bidders.
3. If **"Yes"**, the screen clears, and the next bidder enters their details.
4. If **"No"**, the program calculates the **highest bid** and announces the **winner**.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Dictionaries** (to store bidder names and their bid amounts)
- **Loops** (to allow multiple bidders)
- **Conditional Statements** (to determine the highest bid)
- **Functions** (to identify the highest bidder)
- **String Formatting** (for structured output)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_9_Project_Blind_Auction
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python blind_auction.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to place your bids. üéØ
