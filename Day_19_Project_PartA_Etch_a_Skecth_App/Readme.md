# Day 19 (Part-A) : Etch A Sketch App 🎨

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Etch A Sketch App** is a digital recreation of the classic drawing toy using Python's **turtle module**. This interactive app allows users to draw on the screen using keyboard controls, simulating the original Etch A Sketch experience. 🖍️✨

## 🚀 How It Works

- The user **controls a turtle** to draw on the screen.
- Keyboard keys allow movement in different directions.

◀️ `A` – Turn left\
▶️ `D` – Turn right\
🗑️ `C` – Clear the screen & reset position

## 📌 Concepts Covered

✅ **Turtle Graphics** – Using `turtle` for drawing and movement.\
✅ **Keyboard Event Listeners** – Detecting key presses with `onkey()`.\
✅ **Functions & Control Flow** – Handling user inputs for movement.\
✅ **Screen Manipulation** – Clearing and resetting the drawing.
