# Day 20 - Snake Game (Part 1) 🐍🎮

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Snake Game - Part 1** is the first phase of building the classic **Snake Game** using Python and the **turtle graphics module**. In this part, we implemented the basic movement mechanics, allowing the snake to move around the screen and respond to keyboard inputs.

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ The game initializes a **black screen** with a snake made up of multiple segments.  
2️⃣ The snake moves **automatically** and can be controlled using arrow keys.  
3️⃣ The movement logic ensures the snake **follows itself smoothly**.  
4️⃣ The game loop continuously updates the screen and listens for **key presses** to change direction.  

## 🎮 Controls
🔼 **Up Arrow** - Move Up  
🔽 **Down Arrow** - Move Down  
◀️ **Left Arrow** - Move Left  
▶️ **Right Arrow** - Move Right  

## 📌 Concepts Covered
✅ **Turtle Graphics** – Using `turtle` to create the snake and movement.  
✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Implementing the `Snake` class for structured coding.  
✅ **Loops & Conditional Statements** – Managing continuous movement.  
✅ **Keyboard Event Handling** – Detecting and responding to key presses.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** `turtle`, `time`

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/Day_20_Snake_Game_Part1
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
5. Use the arrow keys to **control the snake** and have fun! 🐍

## 🎉 Fun Facts About the Snake Game

- The **original Snake game** was introduced in **1976** as **Blockade**! 🎮  
- The game became widely popular after being pre-installed on **Nokia mobile phones** in **1998**. 📱  
- A perfect game of **Snake** (covering the entire screen) is almost impossible without **frame-perfect movements**! 🤯  

Stay tuned for **Part 2**, where we'll add **food, scoring, and collision detection!** 🚀
