# Day 15 - Coffee Machine 🍵

## 🔥 Project Overview  
The **Coffee Machine Project** is a Python-based console program that simulates a real coffee vending machine. Users can select from **espresso, latte, or cappuccino**, and the program will handle transactions, check resources, and dispense coffee accordingly.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
- The user selects a coffee type (`espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`).  
- The machine checks if there are enough resources to make the drink.  
- If sufficient resources are available, the user inserts coins.  
- The program calculates the total and checks if the payment is enough.  
- If payment is successful, the machine dispenses the coffee and updates resource levels.  
- Users can also check the `report` to see remaining resources or type `off` to shut down the machine.  

## 📌 Concepts Covered  
- **Functions & Loops** for program structure  
- **Dictionaries & Nested Data** for storing menu & resources  
- **User Input Handling** to simulate coin insertion  
- **Conditional Statements** for decision-making  
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations** to calculate transactions  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** None (only built-in Python features)
