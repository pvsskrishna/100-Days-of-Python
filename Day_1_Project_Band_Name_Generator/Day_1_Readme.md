# Brand Name Generator 🏢🐶

## Project Overview
The **Brand Name Generator** is a simple yet fun tool that helps users generate a **unique brand name** by combining their city of upbringing and their pet's name. It’s great for brainstorming business names, usernames, or creative brand ideas!

## How It Works
1. The user inputs:
   - The **city name** they grew up in.
   - Their **pet’s name**.
2. The program concatenates both inputs to generate a unique **brand name**.
3. The final brand name is displayed for the user.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Print Statements** (to display messages)
- **User Input Handling** (to gather inputs from users)
- **String Concatenation** (to combine inputs into a brand name)
- **Formatted Strings (f-strings)** (for better readability and output formatting)
