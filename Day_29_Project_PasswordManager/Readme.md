# 💼 Day 29: Password Manager GUI 🔐

This Python GUI project is a **Password Manager App** developed using the `Tkinter` library.  
It enables users to generate secure passwords and store login details with a clean and interactive interface.

---

## 📌 Project Name: Password Manager with GUI

### ✅ Features Developed in `main.py`:
✔️ GUI interface using Tkinter with `Labels`, `Entries`, and `Buttons`  
✔️ Save functionality to store website, email/username, and password data into a `.txt` file  
✔️ Password entry field masked for security  
✔️ Integrated with a `logo.png` image as visual branding  
✔️ Includes validation to avoid empty submissions  
✔️ Automatic clearing of fields after saving

---

## 📁 Supporting Files

### 🧠 `Grid_Column_Span.py`
✔️ Demonstrates how to span widgets across multiple grid columns in Tkinter  
✔️ Educational purpose: understanding widget layout alignment for professional GUI designs

### 📄 `save_data.txt`
✔️ Text file where all password records are stored in a consistent format:  
`Website | Email/Username | Password`

### 🖼️ `logo.png`
✔️ PNG image used as the app’s top logo for aesthetics

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.10+)
2. Clone or download the project folder
3. Make sure `logo.png` is in the same directory as `main.py`
4. Run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Fill in your website, email, and password
6. Click "Add" to save your password to `save_data.txt`

## 🧠 Concepts Used
✔️ Tkinter GUI and widget management  
✔️ Grid layout and column spanning  
✔️ File handling (`write` mode) in Python  
✔️ Input validation  
✔️ Packing images using Tkinter's `Canvas`  
✔️ Code modularity with multiple files

---

## 📘 Concepts Learned
✔️ Building secure apps with GUI in Python  
✔️ Implementing user input validation in real-time GUI  
✔️ Designing cleaner, user-friendly interfaces  
✔️ Structuring and managing layout with `grid()` and `columnspan`  
✔️ Practical file handling: saving and managing sensitive data

---

## 💡 Fun Facts
✔️ Inspired by real-world password managers like LastPass and 1Password  
✔️ Built completely with Python’s standard libraries  
✔️ Modular code structure for easier scaling and updates

---

## 📷 Preview
Make sure `logo.png` is available in the same directory to display the top logo when running the app!
