# Rock Paper Scissors Game ðŸŽ®

## Project Overview
This is a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in Python where you compete against the computer. The game continues until either you or the computer reaches a target score of **10**.

## How It Works
1. You are prompted to enter **0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The program compares both choices and determines the round winner.
4. Scores are updated accordingly.
5. The game continues until either player reaches the target score.
6. At the end, you get an option to **play again or exit**.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Random module** (to generate computerâ€™s choice)
- **Conditional statements** (if-elif-else for game logic)
- **Functions** (to organize the code into reusable components)
- **Loops** (while loop for continuous gameplay)
- **String formatting** (f-strings for clear output)
- **Exception handling** (to handle invalid user input)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_4_Project_Rock_Paper_Scissors
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and enjoy the game! ðŸŽ®
