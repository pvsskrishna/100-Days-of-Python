# Day 18 - Turtle Graphics Art 🎨🗺

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Turtle Graphics Art** project explores creative pattern generation using the **turtle module** in Python. This project consists of multiple scripts that draw different geometric shapes, spirals, random walks, and dot paintings inspired by **Hirst's painting style**.

## 🚀 How It Works

Each script uses the **turtle graphics library** to generate unique visual patterns:

1. **Drawing_Dashedline.py** – Draws a dashed line pattern.
2. **Drawing_Square.py** – Draws a perfect square using the turtle.
3. **Drawing_Polygons.py** – Draws polygons from triangles to decagons, each with a random color.
4. **Drawing_spirals.py** – Creates a mesmerizing spiral pattern with random colors.
5. **Generating_Randomwalk.py** – Generates a random walk with changing colors and directions.
6. **Hirst_painting_model1.py & Hirst_painting_model2.py** – Generates a dot painting inspired by the famous artist **Damien Hirst**.

## 📌 Concepts Covered

✅ **Turtle Graphics** – Using the `turtle` module for drawing on-screen.
✅ **Random Module** – Generating **random colors** and movement directions.
✅ **Loops & Functions** – Using loops to draw patterns efficiently.
✅ **Color Modes & Dot Painting** – Using **RGB colors** to create Hirst-style dot paintings.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** `turtle`, `random`

## 🎉 Fun Facts About Turtle Graphics

- **Turtle Graphics** was first introduced in the **1960s** as part of the **LOGO programming language** to teach kids coding! 🚀  
- The **random walk algorithm** is used in physics, economics, and even AI pathfinding! 📊  
- The famous artist **Damien Hirst** inspired the **dot painting technique** used in this project. 🎨  

Enjoy coding and creating amazing patterns! 🎨🚀
