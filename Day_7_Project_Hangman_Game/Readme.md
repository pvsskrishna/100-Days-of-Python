# Hangman Game ðŸŽ­

## Project Overview
This is a **Hangman** game implemented in Python where you try to guess a randomly chosen word before running out of lives.

## How It Works
1. The program selects a **random word** from a predefined list.
2. The word is displayed as underscores (`_`) representing each letter.
3. You guess letters one at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, you lose a life.
6. You have a total of **4 lives** to guess the word correctly.
7. The game ends when you either **guess the word** or **run out of lives**.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Random module** (to choose a word randomly)
- **Lists and Strings** (to store and manipulate the word and guesses)
- **Conditional statements** (to check user input and update game state)
- **Loops** (for repeated guessing and game continuation)
- **Functions** (to organize the game logic)
- **ASCII Art** (to enhance the visual representation of game state)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_7_Project_Hangman
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and try to guess the word before running out of lives! ðŸŽ­

## ASCII Art Resource
This project also makes use of ASCII graphics from **[ascii.co.uk](https://ascii.co.uk/art)** to enhance the user experience.

## Have Fun and Keep Guessing! ðŸš€
