# Day 19 (Part B) - Turtle Racing Championship 🏁🐢

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Turtle Racing Championship** is an exciting Python game where multiple turtles race to the finish line. Users can **place a bet on a turtle color** and watch the race unfold to see if they win! 🎯🐢💨

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ The game displays **multiple racing turtles** of different colors.

2️⃣ The user **places a bet** on which turtle will win.
