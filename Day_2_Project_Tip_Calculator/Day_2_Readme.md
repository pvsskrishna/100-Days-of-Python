# Tip Calculator ðŸ’°

## Project Overview
This **Tip Calculator** helps users split a bill among friends while factoring in a **customizable tip percentage**. It ensures fair payment distribution and makes calculating tips quick and easy!

## How It Works
1. The user inputs:
   - The total **bill amount**.
   - The **tip percentage** they wish to give.
   - The **number of people** splitting the bill.
2. The program calculates the total bill including the tip.
3. The final amount each person should pay is displayed.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Variables** (to store user inputs and calculated values)
- **User Input Handling** (to take inputs from users)
- **Type Conversion** (to ensure proper calculations)
- **Arithmetic Operations** (to compute the total bill and per-person cost)
- **Rounding and f-strings** (to format the output neatly)

   ```bash
