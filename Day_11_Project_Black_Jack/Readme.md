# Blackjack Game 🃏

## Project Overview
This is a **Blackjack game** implemented in Python where you can play against the dealer (computer). The objective is to get a hand value as close to **21** as possible without exceeding it.

## How It Works
1. You and the dealer start with **two cards each**.
2. You can choose to **Hit (draw another card)** or **Stand (keep your total as is)**.
3. If you get **21 on the first two cards**, that's a **Blackjack** and an instant win!
4. If your total **exceeds 21, you lose**.
5. The dealer must **draw until they reach at least 17**.
6. The game compares scores to determine the winner.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Functions & Return Values** (to structure the game logic)
- **Lists & Conditional Statements** (to handle the game flow)
- **Random Module** (for shuffling and dealing cards)
- **Loops** (for player choices and dealer's turn)
- **ASCII Art** (to add a fun visual touch to the game)

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvsskrishna/100-Days-of-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100-Days-of-Python/Day_11_Project_Blackjack
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and **play against the dealer!** 🎰

## Fun Facts About Blackjack 🎲
- The game **originated in France** in the early 1700s and was called "Vingt-et-Un" (French for 21).
- The term "Blackjack" comes from a special payout offered when a player had the **Ace of Spades and a black Jack** (clubs or spades).
- **Card counting** was first introduced in the 1960s by mathematicians to gain an advantage over casinos.
- The longest recorded Blackjack game lasted **over 50 hours**!
- Some casinos ban professional players if they suspect **card counting**, even though it’s not illegal.
